<p>Hi, I am currently a student in Computer Science at University of Toronto. I’m currently working in <span class="caps">APS490</span> designing solutions for polaris to make better decisions for their<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>customers.</p>
<p>I am a highly motivated person with a strong interest in the internet, algorithms, and software<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>design.</p>
<p>I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills to real-world problems as a developer. I have experience in frontend, backend development, MySQL, and Redis. I’m especially interested in distributed systems and cloud<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>computing.</p>

<p><strong><em>May 2018 - June<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2018</em></strong></p>
<p>I worked independently and designed a multiplayer online fps game, it supports players in the same area network to connect and play together. It’s an application server supporting <span class="caps">TCP</span> and <span class="caps">UDP</span> channel, features<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>include: </p>
<ul>
<li>a custom <span class="caps">RPC</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>framework</li>
<li>fault-tolerant system such as in-memory message queue and <span class="caps">TCP</span> sticky
packet processing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system</li>
<li>can support 60-frames game advancing with over 10<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>players</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>May 2021 - Aug<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2021</em></strong></p>
<p>CloudStack is an open-source cloud computing platform belonging to Apache Software Foundation.
I joined as one of the open-source software developers during the Google Summer of Code<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a Clone Virtual Machine feature <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">UI</span> on a large Java codebase over 340k+ lines (<span class="caps">PR</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>#5216)</li>
<li>Proposed a tentative bug fix on Null Pointer Exception involving volume creation (<span class="caps">PR</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>#5383)</li>
<li>Contributed an integration test and unit test to the open source cloud<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>platform</li>
<li>Optimized some of the code implementation and made the cloud Orchestrator <span class="caps">API</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reusable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Jan 2020 - April 2020</em></strong>
I worked independently and developed a programming language using functional programming paradigm.
Features<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>implemented: </p>
<ul>
<li>turn a normal state to <span class="caps">CPS</span> (continuation passing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>style)</li>
<li>Shift, error, reset, try catch<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>statement </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>May 2020 - April<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>2021</em></strong></p>
<p>As a coop, I achieved Achieved zero down time automating the Migration (including Schema generation) of databases with
over <span class="caps">100TB</span> data from legacy pods to Oracle Cloud, improved the original manual process from 1 week to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>days. </p>
<p>At the same time, I improved the <span class="caps">RMS</span> portal performance by making a Redis cache system, delivering way faster response
time than previous NoSQL implementation, Enforced 100% unit test coverage and well-defined functional test for <span class="caps">VM</span> monitoring system. I also Worked closely with the Devops team. Designed and Maintained calendar <span class="amp">&amp;</span> environment status board
from a distributed log system, helping at least 5 dev teams to get quicker feedback on their development
progress. Finally, I Got a Oracle Quarterly Coop Award for implementing the cache<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>system</p>
