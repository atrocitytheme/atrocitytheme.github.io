# Myself

Hi, I am currently a student in Computer Science at University of Toronto. I'm currently working in APS490 designing solutions for polaris to make better decisions for their customers.

I am a highly motivated person with a strong interest in the internet, algorithms, and software design.

I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills to real-world problems as a developer. I have experience in frontend, backend development, MySQL, and Redis. Iâ€™m especially interested in distributed systems and cloud computing.

* For details of my resume, please see: [self intro](/articles/introduction/)

# Project

## [Reap the flag](https://github.com/atrocitytheme/Reap-the-flag)

***May 2018 - June 2018***

I worked independently and designed a multiplayer online fps game, it supports players in the same area network to connect and play together. It's an application server supporting TCP and UDP channel, features include: 
* a custom RPC framework
* fault-tolerant system such as in-memory message queue and TCP sticky
packet processing system
* can support 60-frames game advancing with over 10 players

## [Cloudstack](https://github.com/atrocitytheme/cloudstack)
***May 2021 - Aug 2021***

CloudStack is an open-source cloud computing platform belonging to Apache Software Foundation.
I joined as one of the open-source software developers during the Google Summer of Code event.
* Implemented a Clone Virtual Machine feature & UI on a large Java codebase over 340k+ lines (PR #5216)
* Proposed a tentative bug fix on Null Pointer Exception involving volume creation (PR #5383)
* Contributed an integration test and unit test to the open source cloud platform
* Optimized some of the code implementation and made the cloud Orchestrator API reusable

## [Chups and Hubbs](https://github.com/atrocitytheme/Chups-Hubbub)
***Jan 2020 - April 2020***
I worked independently and developed a programming language using functional programming paradigm.
Features implemented: 
* turn a normal state to CPS (continuation passing style)
* Shift, error, reset, try catch statement 

# Experience
## Software Development Coop @[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/index.html)
***May 2020 - April 2021***

As a coop, I achieved Achieved zero down time automating the Migration (including Schema generation) of databases with
over 100TB data from legacy pods to Oracle Cloud, improved the original manual process from 1 week to
days. 

At the same time, I improved the RMS portal performance by making a Redis cache system, delivering way faster response
time than previous NoSQL implementation, Enforced 100% unit test coverage and well-defined functional test for VM monitoring system. I also Worked closely with the Devops team. Designed and Maintained calendar & environment status board
from a distributed log system, helping at least 5 dev teams to get quicker feedback on their development
progress. Finally, I Got a Oracle Quarterly Coop Award for implementing the cache system
