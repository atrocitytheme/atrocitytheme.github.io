I work for the infrastructure development team and collaborate closely with the Devops team to improve the cloud system and automation process (mainly on CI tool development). Project accomplishments:<strong> </strong>
<ul>

<li><strong>RMS portal system</strong>: A centralized management server that manages states of clusters, VMs, containers, load balancers, authentications of developers, and notification of development events according to a calendar system. This optimizes the efficiency of different dev teams and quicker identification of dev issues.

<li><strong>Uchiwa board agent system</strong>: A distributed log and control system based on Ruby Sensu agents. It provides quicker environmental setup and direct operational API of sensu agent clusters.

<li><strong>Automated database migration</strong>: An automation process to help Devops team migrate the mssql/oracle db automatically. MIgration time improves from a week of manual configurations to just 2 days.
