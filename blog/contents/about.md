I am a highly motivated person with a strong interest in the internet, algorithms, and software design.

I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills to real-world problems as a developer. I have experience in frontend, backend development, MySQL, and Redis. I'm especially interested in distributed systems and cloud computing.
